# Privacy Policy

## Purpose

This project intends to provide users with a unique way of visualizing sessions, windows and tabs. With accessibility in mind, we want to maximize productivity with how users examine, organize, and manipulate their browser sessions.

## Data

Tabbed does not collect any data of any kind.

Tabbed has no home server.

Tabbed doesn't embed any kind of analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.

## Permissions

### Context Menus

We use context menus to provide users with the option to open the extension in different windows, such as a popout window or in a new tab. Users can do this by right clicking on the extension icon.

### Storage

We save user settings and session details locally on the user's chrome browser. None of this data is shared with Tabbed authors.

### Tabs

We use the 'tabs' permission to display details about the current session comprised of windows and tabs. This allows users to rearrange tabs and windows, and perform different actions on the session items.

## Hosting

The project is currently hosted on github.com, which is owned by GitHub Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, and thus is unrelated to Tabbed.
